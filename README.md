======================

InsertResultTemplate is a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) request for inserting a result template into a SOS server that describes the structure of the values of a InsertResult. The insertResulTemplate must be associated to a station/sensor. Once a result template is created in the SOS server for a station/sensor, the template can be used for uploading observations easily.

This application allows to create, based on the Sensor Model Language (SensorML), insertResultTemplate XML requests for each of the parameters measured by the indicated sensor. This application, moreover, allows to send this request to specific SOS server by translactional request.

## Usage

1. select the SOS service endpoint;
2. insert the ID of station/sensor;
3. click on button.
For more information about usage, please consult the guide into application.
